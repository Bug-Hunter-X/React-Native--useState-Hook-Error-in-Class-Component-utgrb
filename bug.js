This error occurs when using the useState hook in a functional component within a class component in React Native.  The useState hook is only designed to work within functional components. Attempting to use it in a class component will result in unexpected behavior and potentially an error.

```javascript
// Incorrect usage in a class component
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = useState(0); // ERROR: useState is not defined here
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <View>
        <Text>{this.state}</Text>
      </View>
    );
  }
}
```
